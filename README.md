# LastFM Jumble Discord Bot

A Discord bot that hosts a jumble game based on the top artists of a last.fm user.

The game chooses a random artist from the user's top artists and jumbles the letters of the artist's name.

You have provided a few hints, and anyone in the chat has to guess the artist's name correctly within 25 seconds.

Made with the [sern](sern.dev) framework.

```
